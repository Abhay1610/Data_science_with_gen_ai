        "Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification problems. Unlike linear regression which predicts continuous values it predicts the probability that an input belongs to a specific class. It is used for binary classification where the output can be one of two possible categories such as Yes/No, True/False or 0/1. It uses sigmoid function to convert inputs into a probability value between 0 and 1."

Given an imbalanced dataset (only 5% of customers respond), describe the approach you’d take to build a Logistic Regression model — including data handling, feature scaling, balancing classes, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating the model for this real-world business use case.\n"

So, the model should not be biased to detect only the majority class but should give equal weight or importance to the minority class, too.
